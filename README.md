The vocab2.py is where you will store a new vocabulary that you come across. You have to input three things ( the word, its meaning and the context where it is often used). If you meet a word that has multiple meanings, you can enter the first meaning. then write 'x' at a new word box and continue to put its new meaning.
The checkvocab.py is where you can review your new vocabulary. The app will show you a word and three different meanings. Your work is to choose the correct meaning of that word.
